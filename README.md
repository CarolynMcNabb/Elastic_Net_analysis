In this repository, you will find data, scripts and output files needed to reproduce findings reported in our 2020 paper:
Carolyn B. McNabb, Laura G. Burgess, Amy Fancourt, Nancy Mulligan, Lily FitzGibbon, Patricia Riddell, Kou Murayama. 
No evidence for a relationship between social closeness and similarity in resting-state functional brain connectivity in schoolchildren. 
Scientific Reports (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-67718-8 


YOU WILL NEED R AND MATLAB TO RUN THE SCRIPTS
R version 4.0.1 (2020-06-06) -- "See Things Now" AND MATLAB 2015b should work.
PLEASE READ THE COMMENTS IN THE SCRIPTS CAREFULLY - THESE CONTAIN VALUABLE INFORMATION TO HELP YOU SAVE TIME AND 
GET WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF THE DATA. YOU MAY NEED TO INSTALL SOME LIBRARIES IN R OR LOAD LIBRARIES THAT ARE COMMENTED
OUT.


Scripts need to be run in the following order:
1. a1_correlations_for_rsfMRI (MATLAB)
2. a2_correlations_for_RSNs (MATLAB)
3. a3_modules_per_brain (MATLAB)

4. s1_CM_socialnetwork_analysis (R)
5. s2_comm_similarities (MATLAB)
6. s3_SN_fMRI_looped_mutual_ties (R)
7. s4_prediction_modelling (MATLAB)
8. s5_elastic_find_best_alpha (R)
